The Gaze Tracking System is an AI-based computer vision project that detects and analyzes a user’s eye movements to determine their point of gaze in real time. Using a standard webcam, it tracks the position of the pupils and estimates where the person is looking on the screen.

🔹 Features

Real-time gaze detection and tracking

Works with standard webcams

Detects eye and pupil positions using facial landmarks

Displays the user’s point of gaze visually on screen

🔹 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV – image processing and camera handling

Dlib / Mediapipe – facial and eye landmark detection

NumPy – numerical calculations

🔹 Applications

Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)

Assistive technologies for differently-abled users

UX and eye-focus research

Gaming and VR interaction systems
